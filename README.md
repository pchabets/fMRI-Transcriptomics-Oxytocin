# fMRI-Transcriptomics-Oxytocin
Differential oxytocin mRNA expression in brain areas affected by intranasal oxytocin. 

Steps to run scripts and reproduce results:

1) download all needed files from our Github page and store them in a local folder

2) download all donor microarray data from https://human.brain-map.org/static/download and place in the same local folder. The six donor folders 
-normalized_microarray_donor9861 
-normalized_microarray_donor10021
-normalized_microarray_donor12876
-normalized_microarray_donor14380
-normalized_microarray_donor15496
-normalized_microarray_donor15697

should be renamed respectively:

-normalized_microarray_donor01
-normalized_microarray_donor02
-normalized_microarray_donor03
-normalized_microarray_donor04
-normalized_microarray_donor05
-normalized_microarray_donor06

3) in the beginning of each script, set the working directory to your local folder that contains all files and folders from steps 1-2.

4) install all needed packages.

5) run the scripts.
